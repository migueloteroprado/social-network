## LocalStorage

The articles and subscriptions are saved in the browser's LocalStorage:

#### Articles

Key: **social.articles**
Fields: id, author UUID, title, content

```json
{
  "id": 1, 
  "author": "b49c9afe-b1b4-4d2f-bc5d-d5bfd9211dcf",
  "title": "This is the Article Number One",
  "content": "Lorem ipsum ........"
}
```
The article list will be loaded at the App startup, and will be saved into the articles reducer.
When a new article is added, the whole article list will be saved back into the LocalStorage

#### Subscriptions

Key: **social.subscriptions**
Fields: author, subscriptor, state

```json
{
  "author": "04fb2afc-0fc3-4ee9-b4f1-10113562af6f",
  "subscriptor": "b49c9afe-b1b4-4d2f-bc5d-d5bfd9211dcf",
  "state": "pending"
}
```

The subcription list will be loaded at the App startup, and saved into the subscriptions reducer.
When a change in subscriptions list occurs (add, remove, or change subscription state), the whole list will be saved back to the LocalStorage

---

The app will first load the authors list from randomuser API before showing anything else. If an error occurs, a message will be shown and the app won't start

After that, it will load articles and subscriptions from LocalStorage and will render the application

---

## SessionStorage

The current logged in user in saved also in the SessionStorage (Key **social.currentAuthor**), allowing to reload the page without signing in again
